The Creation of Inner Worlds

Inner Worlds was created through the efforts of many talented people from around the world brought together by the power and magic of the internet. Sleepless IDT wishes to acknowledge their efforts by thanking all of the team members and bestowing upon them as a whole the prestigious title they so richly deserve:

Inner Worlds IDT #1
Congratulations to all IDT members and thanks for all of your hard work. It's been a struggle, but we can all be proud of what we've accomplished.

Joe Hitchens
Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

Project Manager and humble leader of this eclectic band of cybergypsies. Principal game designer. Principal artist. Principal mapper. General programming.

"There now. That didn't take long did it?"

Bryan Ford
Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

Head Programmer. Bryan is primarily responsible for the core graphics engine used in Inner Worlds (CLAWS) as well as the programming of the most important components of the system. Without Bryan, this project could never have been started, could never have been finished and could never have been the superbly innovative and successful game that it is.

George Hoffman
Woodlynne, New Jersey, USA

George has been one of the most valuable programmers on the team. He holds the distinction of being one of only a tiny few who have beheld the CLAWS and not gone mad in the experience. Guardian of Colleen's chastity. He brought The Claws to life.

Jürgen Quade
Munich, Germany

Jürgen's enthusiasm has helped us all through the toughest parts of the project and for that we all owe him our thanks. Preserver of worlds. Freezer of time. Master Mapper. Keeper of the lost Ghibli.

"It's not enough to see art, you have to feel it. Without any doubt program- ming is one kind of computer art. Unfortunately you can not even see it!"

Heinee Hinrichsen
Sandy, Utah, USA

An artist of unappreciated talents. Much of the artwork in Inner Worlds is the work of this guy. Skrog, Bocha, Boonta, Skiver, Big Eye, Big Bat and that groovy blue GRALOB! Lots of work on many of Nikita's animations.

Craig Peeper
Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, USA

Our own private sound man. Craig's contribution is in the form of a superb quality custom music and sound effects driver. It actually works pretty dang good!

Normunds Saumanis
Riga, Latvia

Normunds discovered the seltzer of life and brought it to the rest of us. The first to see Nikita transform into a wolf. Planter and caretaker of the Mana Tree. Sound effects too!

Brent Johnson
Stow, Ohio, USA

Brent created the crystal hammer. He brought life to Ibu the owldog. Stunned some monsters. Made some sound effects. Brent invented ** THE BOMB **.
...and now he's a daddy!

Mick Barry
Sydney, Australia

Other end of the world, but always present. Mick has been one of the most prolific members of the team. Always present on the mailing list and helpful in many ways. Always a day ahead of everyone else. Veteran Nikky mechanic.

István Markó
Eugene, Oregon, USA

István has been with us from the start. He made a nest of bugs, a hideous skrog, the lightweight gift for Nikita and the Gralob's brain.

Eric Moon
Seattle, Washington, USA

Eric is a palette manipulator extraordinaire. The light and color wizard for Inner Worlds. He also built the first pager.
